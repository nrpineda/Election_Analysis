# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview

In this Module we explore the use of VS Code to execute python files, as well as GitBash and GitHub to push and showcase our data analysis. Furthermore, we worked with Tom and Seth retrieving The data of the results of an Election. The final goal was to obtain the total number of votes casts for each candidate, the percentage of votes each candidate won, the total number of votes for each, and the winner of the Election based on the higher number of votes.

We were able to analyze this data, by learning how to open, import and explore a CSV file (which is a plain text format that separates the data with commas) within  VS COde. While exploring this file, we obtained the name of all the candidates running in this election. With python functions, we learned to do calculations from the data, such as the end results of the election, as well as write python codes that would create other logical operations to find out more about this large data set of information. 

## Resources

The name for the data file used in this project is: election_results.csv; and
The Software used to perform this analysis were Python 3.7, Visual Studio Code.

## Summary

The results for this project are the following:

The total number of votes casts in this election are: 369,711
The name of the candidates running in this election are:
  Charles Casper Stockham.
  Diana DeGette
  Raymond Anthony Doane.
 
The respective number of votes that each candidate received are the following:

Charles Casper Stockham received 85,213 (23.0%) votes.
Diana DeGette received 272,892 (73.8%) votes.
Raymon Anthony Doane received 11,606 (3.1%) votes.

As this statistics show, Diana DeGette won this election with the 73.8% of the votes.

## Challenge Overview

This Module was packed with coding activities and new tools offered by the Software Python, that help create an overall analysis with a large dataset that otherwise could not be done on softwares such as Excel in the same amount of time. The functions available within this program allow a data analyst to cut its time by a fragment with logical ways to communicate, and obtain results from this program. 

## Challenge Summary.

Through the use of the text editor VS Code, we analyzed and recorded an outcome for an Election by scripting a code that can be run as a Python file. The VS Code was an incredible tool that allows the coders to see any syntax or any errors while typing the code seamlessly as it is color coded to easily recognize a function for example. It also contains other tools within that make typing the script easy, as it is a user-friendly program; in this case the users being the coders.
